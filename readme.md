## Data File Format üìÑ

The calculator expects a `CONSTANTS.js` file with the following structure:

```javascript
export const PROFESSIONS = {
    basic: ["Artisan", "Brawler", "Entertainer", ...],
    elite: ["Architect", "Armorsmith", ...],
    forceSensitive: ["Combat Prowess", ...],
    jedi: ["Lightsaber", "Powers", ...]
};

export const ALL_PROFESSIONS = {
    profession_key: {
        master: "skill_id",
        branch_1: { skills: [...], links: [...] },
        branch_2: { skills: [...], links: [...] },
        branch_3: { skills: [...], links: [...] },
        branch_4: { skills: [...], links: [...] },
        novice: "skill_id",
        novice_links: [...]
    }
};

export const SKILLS = {
    skill_id: {
        title: "Skill Name",
        skillPoints: 5,
        preReqs: ["prereq_skill_id"],
        xp: { id: "type", cost: 1000 },
        skillModifiers: { mod_name: value },
        commands: ["ability1", "ability2"],
        schematics: ["schematic1"]
    }
};
```

### Key Functions
- `loadDataFile()` - Parses CONSTANTS.js upload
- `renderSkillTree()` - Displays profession skill tree
- `toggleSkill()` - Handles skill selection/deselection
- `updateAccumulatedData()` - Aggregates stats across selected skills
- `isValidAbility()` - Filters malformed ability entries

### Known Issues üêõ
- Some ability entries from CONSTANTS.js may contain malformed data
- Title filtering needs refinement for skill-specific titles

### Debugging
Press F12 to open browser console and look for:
- `=== ABILITIES DEBUG ===` messages
- Skill data parsing information
- Validation warnings
